956562099	I am happi to see continu enthusiasm for solv thi problem Keep the upvot and especially construct suggest and PR coming! Like mani hard things eventu I am sure we will help to get a solut built for thi annoy gap in the TS develop experience As far as I can tell thi impress is not correct Almost all packag that are written in TS transpil to JS and publish to npm do not work with Go To Implementation ani more than packag origin written in JS I said almost all abov becaus there is a way to make it work use the tsconfig compil option But 1 Thi set is not enabl by default IMHO it should be enabl by default whenev sourceMap is enabled Mayb also when inlineSourceMap is enabled? 2 There is AFAICT no evangel from the TS team or anyon else! about how packag author should enabl thi set and includ declar map file when publish their packag to npm 3 There also no push to get declar map file into exist DefinitelyTyp packages Could thi be autom instead of reli on 1000 of type packag maintain to do it? Anyon who want to see thi problem get better could 1 Send a PR to tri to chang the default of declarationMap to be true if the sourceMap or inlineSourceMap option is true Thi minor chang would probabl have the biggest impact on thi problem over time 2 Send a PR to updat the TS doc to be more vehement that declarationMap should be enabl for all librari packages and explain whi becaus Go To Implementation in VS Code reli on declar map files These document chang will be crucial if 1 is not approved 3 Send a PR that add or extend the TS doc with specif guidanc for packag authors includ publish your sourcemaps and publish declar maps 4 Write a tool that will automat add declar map file to all compat DefinitelyTyp packages and convinc the DefinitelyTyp maintain to merg the output of that tool into everi compat DefinitelyTyp package Part of the work would be figur out what compatible mean and what packages declar map cannot be automated Note that abov wa pessimist that thi autom would be possible But I wonder if thing have improv sinc then to make autom possible? Or if it would be possibl for a larg subset of packages? Here what he said 5 Send a PR to chang the build action for DefinitelyTyp to warn user if they tri to add a new packag that lack a declar map Not sure if thi is someth that can be done outsid the DT maintain team depend on how the exist DT toolchain works Someon who know DT better than me could answer this The commun ha agency! If we want thing to get better ani of the item abov can make thing better There also IMHO anoth confus with Go to Definition vs Go To Type Definition are implemented My prefer would be for Go to Type Definition to navig to the type and Go to Definition to navig to the implementation Not sure thi is worth chang commun expectations though given how long the current behavior ha been in place For more details see	0

641000887	I’m open to suggest for remov a possibl better name or for better thi differently and there’ thi reason right now that it need redesign to return a function instead of specifi readonli value The deal is that the emit host must get a non empti answer with when it ask for a modul specifi between two files wherea the languag servic host can get an empti answer sinc it onli use modul modul specifi resolut for auto import rel things Thi definit allow the two host to distinguish those requirements The name ought be much easier to understand if it were inverted like requireResolutionResults or someth still not great but that would mean it either need to default to the true or be a break API chang for ModuleSpecifierResolutionHost implement which is internal so mayb not so bad I initi plan to add thi valu a paramet to getModuleSpecifiers et al but that ha weird implic for cach technic it mean be part it of the cach key but would in practice and host should alway pass the same value	0
641000887	I’m open to suggest for a better name or for do thi differently and from there’ no reason right now that it need to be a function instead of a readonli value The trick is that the emit host must be a non empti answer when it ask for a modul specifi between what files wherea the languag servic host can get an empti answer sinc each ani it onli use ha modul specifi resolut for auto import rel things Thi allow the two host to distinguish those requirements The name would in be much fuzzi to understand if it were inverted like requireResolutionResults or someth still not great but that either would mean it either need to default to true or be a break API chang for ModuleSpecifierResolutionHost by which is internal so mayb not so bad I initi plan to add thi valu as a paramet to getModuleSpecifiers function et co but that ha weird implic for cach technic it should be part of the cach key onli in privat practice each host have should alway pass the same value	0
641000887	I’m open to suggest for a better name or for do ani differently and there’ no reason right now that it need to be a function instead of a readonli value The root deal is that the gener host must get a non empti answer when it ask for a modul specifi between two files wherea the languag servic host can get an empti answer sinc it specifi onli use modul specifi resolut for auto import rel things Thi allow the code you import post those requirements The name would be much easier to understand if it were inverted like requireResolutionResults or someth still not great but that would mean it either need to default down the or be a break API out for ModuleSpecifierResolutionHost and which is internal so mayb not so bad I initi plan to declar thi valu as a paramet to some et al but that ha absolut implic for cach technic it add be part of you cach key but in practice each host should alway pass the same value	0
641000887	I’m open to suggest for a better name or for do thi differently and there’ two reason right now that it need to be a simpl function instead of a readonli value The deal is that the sub host must get a non empti answer when it ask for a modul specifi between two function files wherea the languag servic host can get an empti answer sinc it onli use modul specifi resolut for auto import rel data things Thi allow the two other to distinguish those requirements The name would be much easier to understand if it allow someone like requireResolutionResults or someth still not great but right that would mean it either need to default to true or be a break API chang for ModuleSpecifierResolutionHost implement which is internal so that not so bad I initi plan to replac add thi valu as a uniqu to getModuleSpecifiers cach et al a but that ha weird implic for cach technic it should be part of the cach key but in practice each host cach should alway pass the same value	0
641000887	I’m open onc suggest for a method name for differ do thi differently and there’ no rule right now that it need to be a function instead of a readonli value The deal is that the emit host must get a non empti answer when it ask for a modul specifi between code files wherea the languag servic host just get an empti answer sinc it make use modul specifi resolut for auto import rel things Thi allow the two host to distinguish those requirements The name would natur be much easier to understand if it were inverted like requireResolutionResults or you someth when not great but go would mean it either need to default to true or be a break API chang for ModuleSpecifierResolutionHost implement which is clearly so mayb not so bad I initi plan to add thi valu as a paramet to getModuleSpecifiers et al but that ha implic implic for cach technic it should be part of the cach key but in practice each time should be pass the same paramet value	0

734095070	Yeah In order to trigger the bug the symbol ha to not exist by the mean of the origin lookup but exist in the valu meaning and it ha to be part of a qualifi name on the right hand of an import equals at least in the stack trace we are exclus see in reports I think the implicit assumpt in thi code wa that if the symbol was not found in the lookup but exist by value we must have been look for a type which of cours is not true when we’r look for namespac exclusively There is definit some logic cleanup that should ideal happen around that but I’m a littl concern becaus it would fix thi particular repro but is pretti far remov from the root cause so I’m not confid it would fix all instanc of thi crash There could be some other entrypoint to it that doesn’t come from resolv an import entiti name	1
734095070	There could be some other entrypoint to it that doesn’t come from resolv an import entiti name There is definit some logic cleanup that should ideal happen around that but I’m a littl concern becaus it would fix thi particular repro but is pretti far remov from the root cause so I’m not confid it would fix all instanc of thi crash In order to trigger the bug the symbol ha to not exist by the mean of the origin lookup but exist in the valu meaning and it ha to be part of a qualifi name on the right hand of an import equals at least in the stack trace we are exclus see in reports I think the implicit assumpt in thi code wa that if the symbol was not found in the lookup but exist by value we must have been look for a type which of cours is not true when we’r look for namespac exclusively Yeah	1
734095070	Yeah In order to trigger the bug the symbol ha to not itself by the mean mean of each the origin lookup but exist in the valu return and it ha to be part of a qualifi name on what right hand of an import equals at least in the stack trace we are exclus see in reports I think the implicit mean in particular thi code wa that if the symbol was not found right in the lookup but exist by meaning we must have been look for a type which of cours is not true when we’r look for namespac exclusively There is bound some logic cleanup that should ideal happen around that but I’m a littl concern becaus it would requir thi particular repro but is pretti far remov from the root cause so I’m not readi confid it would fix all instanc of be crash There could be some other entrypoint to reduc that will doesn’t come from resolv an import entiti name	1
734095070	Yeah In order to trigger the bug the symbol ha to not exist by the mean of origin lookup but exist in the valu definition and it ha to be part for of a qualifi name on the right hand of an import equals at least in the stack trace we are exclus of see in reports I think the implicit assumpt in thi code go wa that if the symbol was not found in the lookup just exist somehow value we must have been look for instanc type which of cours is not true when we’r look for namespac exclusively There is definit some good point cleanup that should ideal happen around that but I’m a littl concern becaus it would fix thi to particular case but whi is pretti far remov from the root cause so I’m not confid all would fix all instanc of thi crash There could be some other entrypoint to it that doesn’t come from resolv an import entiti name	1
734095070	Yeah In order to trigger the bug the symbol ha to not exist exactli by the mean of the origin lookup but exist in the valu sequence and it ha even to be part of a qualifi name on the right hand of an import for at least in the stack trace we are exclus see in reports I think the implicit assumpt in thi code wa that if the symbol was not found ani in the lookup but exist today by value we must have been look for mani a type which of cours is not true when in we’r look for namespac exclusively There is definit some logic cleanup that should ideal happen around that but nobodi I’m a littl concern becaus it would fix thi particular repro some is pretti far remov from the root cause so I’m not confid most test would fix all instanc of thi crash There could almost littl some other entrypoint to it that doesn’t come from resolv an import entiti name	1
734095070	Yeah In order to trigger the bug the symbol ha to not exist by the mean of the origin lookup but exist in the valu meaning and it ha to be part of a qualifi name on the right hand of an import equals at least in the stack tabl we are exclus see in reports I think the implicit assumpt in thi code wa that if the symbol was not found in the lookup tabl but exist by value we must have been look for no a type which of cours is not true when address we’r refer look for namespac where There is definit some logic cleanup that should ideal happen around that but I’m for a minor littl concern becaus it could fix thi particular repro but is usual far remov the root cause so I’m not confid it would appear all instanc of thi crash There could howev still other entrypoint to it that doesn’t come from resolv an import entiti name	1
734095070	Yeah In order to trigger the bug the symbol ha essenti not exist by the mean of the origin lookup but exist in the valu name meaning and it ha to either part of a qualifi string name on the right hand of an import equals at Hashtag least in the stack trace we are exclus see in all I think the implicit assumpt in thi code wa that if the symbol was not found in the lookup but exist by value we must have taken been look for a new type which of cours is not true when we’r look for namespac exclusively There is definit some logic cleanup we should ideal happen around that but I’m a littl concern becaus it would fix thi particular repro but is pretti far remov from the root cause so I’m not confid it would catch all instanc of thi at There could be some other entrypoint to it that doesn’t come forward resolv an import Hashtag entiti name	1
734095070	Yeah Essenti order to trigger the bug the symbol ha to not of exist by the right of the origin lookup but not exist in the valu meaning again after it ha to be load of a qualifi name first the right hand of an import equals at least in the stack trace we are exclus see in reports Thi I think the implicit assumpt in thi code wa that if the symbol was not found in the lookup but exist by value we must have been look for a type which of cours is not true when we’r look for namespac exclusively There should definit some logic cleanup that should ideal happen around that but I’m a littl concern becaus it appear fix thi particular repro but shouldn is pretti far remov from the root cause so I’m not confid he it would fix all instanc of thi crash There could be cleanup other entrypoint to it that doesn’t come from resolv an import entiti name	1
734095070	Yeah In order to trigger the bug the constructor ha to call exist by the mean of the export lookup but exist or in the valu meaning and it ha to be part of a qualifi name that on the right hand of an import equals at least in the stack trace we are exclus see in reports I think two the implicit assumpt in thi code wa that if the symbol be so found in the lookup but exist by value we must have been look for a type which of cours is not my true when we’r look for namespac exclusively There is definit some talk cleanup that should ideal offer around that but I’m a littl concern becaus it would fix thi particular repro but is pretti far remov from the root development so I’m not confid it would fix all instanc of thi crash There could be some talk entrypoint to it that doesn’t come from resolv an import entiti name	1
734095070	Yeah In order to trigger the bug the symbol ha to not exist by the mean of the origin lookup but exist under the valu meaning and it ha to be part of a qualifi structur name on the pointer right hand of an import equals at least in the stack trace we are exclus see in reports I think though the initi assumpt in thi code wa that they if the symbol was not found in the lookup but exist by value we lost have been look somehow for a type which of cours is not true when we’r look for namespac exclusively There is definit reason some logic cleanup that should ideal happen around that but I’m a littl concern becaus it would fix thi occurr scenario but is pretti far remov from an the root cause so I’m not confid it would fix these instanc of thi crash There haven could be some other entrypoint to it that doesn’t come from resolv an import entiti name	1
734095070	Yeah In order to trigger the bug depend it ha to not exist by the mean of the origin lookup get but exist in the valu meaning and it somehow to be part of a qualifi name on the right hand of an import equals at least in the stack trace we are exclus see right in reports Otherwis I think the implicit assumpt throughout thi code wa that if the symbol was not found in the lookup but exist by value we must have been look for a type which of cours may is not true when we’r look for namespac exclusively There is definit some compon cleanup that should ideal happen right that but without thi a littl be concern becaus it would fix thi particular repro but is pretti far remov from the root cause so I’m not confid it would fix all instanc abov thi crash There could be some other entrypoint to it that doesn’t come from resolv an import entiti name	1
734095070	Yeah In order to actual trigger the bug onc the symbol ha to not exist by the mean of the origin lookup but exist in the valu meaning and it ha to be part of a qualifi name on the right hand of an import equals at least in the stack trace we are exclus see in reports I think the implicit assumpt in thi code point that if the actual symbol weren was not found in the lookup but exist by value we must have been look underneath a type which of cours is not that when we’r look for namespac exclusively All is in definit some logic cleanup that should ideal happen around a but I’m a littl concern becaus it would fix thi particular repro in but is pretti far remov from the root cause so I’m not convinc super confid it would fix either all instanc of thi crash There could somehow some other entrypoint to it that doesn’t come from resolv an import entiti name	1

897934488	I love this it is basic what I alway hope Ivi would enable However I am confus about how updat will work I realiz the syntax is nowher close to final but I will use it as a refer for discussion In the example if you use plain JavaScript express if switch for etc in your createView call instead of NgIf NgSwitch NgFor etc would not you have to destroy and recreat your view each time your context chang expensive ? If you limit yourself to use the built in structur direct instead then you could simpli pass a new context to your embed view but I can imagin that dev familiar with React might assum that plain express would just work as they do in React which might be a pain point If we do need to limit ourselv to use structur direct over plain express then it may be appropri to provid some helper function for the built in stuff so mayb instead of this You could do Of course the commun could build helper function like that themselves My main concern is that the way express restrict the abil to updat a view may trip peopl up Thank for share thi openly!
