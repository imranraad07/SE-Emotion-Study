797078303	Guys I am veri confus by thi situation documentation exampl and workarounds I am on Webpack 5 I do appreci work that Webpack team doe and would happili donat money if somebodi could put clariti in this It is so frustrat that I am happi to pay just to get an answer There is of how Webpack can understand that we are import a worker That help us to not creat a separ entri point ok But it does not demonstr how worker and not worker would share modul from a separ chunk It look like webpack 5 cannot do that correct? Is there a suggest way on how to do that? In the exampl we have chat worker which import histori from chat module while example js creat a worker from chat worker The result bundl is 2 file main js and chat js but there is no code share between chat worker j and example js! fibonacci is kind of the same case Let add import of chat module into the example js like this And result of such bundl is this chat module js appear twice in our bundle insid main js and insid chat js So pleas can somebodi give a clear answer on how can I get the result like this main js import chat module js from a chunk like chat module chunk js chat worker js import chat module js from a chunk like chat module chunk js main js use chat worker js and staff work Smile Now imagin a situat when main js import 5 differ modul includ soeth from npm while worker j includ 5 of the same modules What is the webpack config j magic should be written to put those 5 modul in one singl chunk? Not all of those modul are from npm some from my project they are from differ folders All my attempt of chunk split optim do not produc workabl app Right now I have to live with chunk which ha huge portion of modul duplic becaus worker import bunch of staff and the main app import same staff Do I have to chang all import to dynamic? Do I need to do that onli in the worker or I have to do that in both places? and after ask webpack to split onli async chunks? Which function should I use for that? How I should direct webpack to produc particular modul I want into a singl chunk? Update From my current understand webpack would figur out chunk automat onli if we import same modul dynamically const fibonacci await import fibonacci If we do so in the worker and in the main app fibonacci modul would be in a separ file Is that correct? But whi do we have to do that not onli in the worker but also in the main app? Whi cannot we do await import in the worker while have static import in the main app and webpack would understand that?	1

946417006	My guess is no sinc implement such a featur can compromis the secur of your app and also it could lead to your app be reject from the store You might think it is a good idea to implement it so it can be use for development however sinc thi is a work around you will not control it will be easi to forget about it which may lead to your app be rejected	0

717953293	I worri about an over reli on Action and Intent when I see ReplaceTextIntent UpdateSelectionIntent etc use here Is there a use case for need those thing to be overridable? What I am worri about is the increas mental load that a develop work on thi part of the codebas ha to bear 1 I cannot be certain who will respond to thi Intent or even whether or not the EditableTextSt will receiv it without know what overrid are in the widget tree 2 These Intent can be invok from anywher with the relev BuildContext Do these two featur benefit thi code in ani way?	0
933720391	Yes with immediate cover the use befor assigned error it make more sense My concern wa whether immediate would not cover these scenarios	0
948345405	Pleas correct me if I am wrong – you are use someth like to emb Flutter as a module In your test you have a script or someth to set up the app and transit to the Flutter screen after which you want to have code on the host connect to and run the integr test It not possibl to do so without some elabor hacks Integr Test requir test code to be built into the app under test It sound what you could do is creat a placehold Flutter app that host the flutter modul that you are using with some mock to setup the app into a state suitabl for testing Otherwise you are advis to look for someth like to test the complet flow	0
664541822	So thi is a littl bit worrying By make thi abstract the noImplicitOverride seem to have no effect on the method in the child class which sort of defeat the purpos of thi compil set right? I e if the base class remov the abstract method there would be no indic to updat the child class	0

932519103	FWIW I’v alway want thi feature but I’m not confid that a PR would get accept and I would hate to see you burn by infinit bikeshed as a first time contributor If thi featur is your passion don’t let me stop you from implement it but be prepar that a PR for an “await more feedback” issu may or may not ever get a proper review If you are just look to start contribut to TS anywhere I would encourag you to search for “help wanted” and “good first issue” labels where you’r much more like to get support with a PR from start to finish	0

670010894	I don’t think thi is a suffici condition Thi is a realli weird case becaus there actual is no symbol for import meta but becaus complet work with symbols it creat a dummi symbol for it on line 1593 and presum the same crash happen with new target The least we can do is keep thi kludg privat to completions ts and not ask the checker for the type of a complet made up symbol with liter no context The checker know how to get the proper type for import meta and new target from a node so I would suggest make completions ts somehow awar that it need to use a differ method to get the type of these and abl to trace these dummi symbol back to the node they came from	0

901297945	There are two separ concern here Is syntact unreachable code code which we can be certain cannot execut allowed?

That is the realm of assertNever Keep these concept separate rather than conflat them is the simpler design	0
928049597	Not that I know of Still an open bug for my team	0
950371551	Yeah that is not right The issu here is that we bypass cach of relat for small union and intersections but that bypass also caus us to loos a check for deepli nest type that would have stop the recursion It use to not matter but after 41821 it does We need to revis our logic such that we can bypass cach but still check for deep nesting	0

350689381	I am not say we do not want to enabl thi kind of thing I am just say we have littl interest in one off PnP specif things when a more complet approach would render it redund and allow for more use case to be filled and that thi model specifically follow a pattern that we do not consid particularli usabl we should know it is similar in setup to our exist languag servic plugin architectur that does not layer plugin easily is not easi to develop for is not particularli easi to use is not well documented and and wa rush out to support a high pressur request from angular We v had request for custom resolv behavior for approxim forever and would like to do right by those and not repeat the mistak we have alreadi made in a differ context	1
954717019	I myself also think that decoupl the materi and also the cupertino librari from the flutter framework would be a major benefit for the whole ecosystem All the librari get more and more complex just to support legaci m2 styling Also thing like the m2 snackbar style are still opt in becaus of that It current is quit pain to creat a new flutter app that use all widget in it modern styling as you have to opt into so mani things And also have to fight with all the old m1 properti and major inconsist everywhere I think have a materi library that is version independ from flutter enabl develop to updat the flutter version of old mainten project without the need to handl break chang in the materi library would be a major benefit for everyone as it not onli would make the life of each maintain much more easy as break chang do happen over time but also make the life of everyon else who want to have the modern style so much easier as the materi librari packag could just have break chang follow semver etc Altogeth I would say especi if we are tri to think long term the benefit outweigh the cost by far So I would veri much recommend to fix thi rather soon then late so that we do not have the same convers again when materail4 arriv Smile	0

731287799	my idea wa inde to be veri loos in the test and basic just match that anyth except space and newlin and whatnot and just test that aspect in a specif decid test got inspir from here stuck out tongue winking eye heart eyes but it depend on what regex we end up use I guess I think you are suggest that each type of comment can have differ newlin etc so we should inde test that in the variou tests? I sort of like the idea of here basic just test the actual content of what we get and not care about space whatsoever but if you do not think it is the right approach mean that we cannot just deleg it all to one or a small number of dedic tests I can be more strict in the variou test as you are suggest slightly smiling face also if we are talk about strictness would you reckon we can also tri to match the exact number of space instead of use or would that make the test far too brittle?	0

954259800	Apologies I should have been more specif with my comment What I meant to say is that Flutter plugin and even pure Dart packages use FFI are in need of be abl to detect a hot restart as much as plugin use platform channels Given thi is a development tim onli issue I would be happi with as simpl a mechan as possible The effect I am tri to fix is that I am make use of a nativ librari eg C Rust etc which hold one or more resourc eg sockets bluetooth audio etc which need to be releas on stop On Linux desktop as an example thi happen if the host OS process is destroy dure debug when the Flutter app is stopped but doe not happen dure a hot restart I have to be honest and admit I do not know the detail of what happen dure a Dart hot restart but it seem to be that the run Isolate s? is kill and then start again? Ani how the effect is that Dart side refer to the nativ librari are lost while the nativ librari continu to run potenti on it own thread s To fix the above I would request have some sort of lifecycl sync callback that can be regist by an app to be call prior to hot restart take place Thi would allow me as the app author the chanc to call ani requir close destroy stop etc on nativ librari or for that matter platform channel plugins that I am use to have them cleanup their resourc usage Thi then does not impact or requir chang from exist nativ librari as they would be expect to alreadi be provid some sort of cleanup resourc API and platform channel plugin do not need to be awar of thi API it just someth a plugin user know to make use of in order I know thi can potenti block hot restart but as the app author I will have had to explicitli regsit for thi callback and then do someth to block that callback complet so that on me as the app author plu I have alreadi experienc exist bug that caus hot restart to stall so it not someth that would block dev work but it would at least give app author that are make use of such nativ librari and platform channel plugin the effect use of hot restart again Ideal I would expect thi be done upstream in Dart becaus hot restart is a Dart mechan and there is an alreadi https github com dart lang sdk issues 42679 but I understand that pure Dart usag is a nich usag compar to Flutter so I would be happi just for a Flutter specif implementation	0
