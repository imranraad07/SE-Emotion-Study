850845815	oh perfect Which version wa it ad to?	1
657369594	Thank you so veri much!!! smiley yeah also in my PR comment I was not total sure if thi wa a break chang but yeah sinc those can be referenc in js code it doe realli seem like a break change! I also total agree that identifi the problem can be quit difficult especi in complex projects whilst the workaround is straightforward Anoth thing that I do not like is that thi kind of break angular view encapsul contract by actual leak some css unbeknown of the user opposit to what happen to the nativ shadow dom About the scope name be a suffix I think you are right I did not realli put much thought on where to put the scope name to be honest bi prefix felt natur as it is sort of what happen with classes the scope get put befor the actual element I will amend it slightly smiling face	1
656831098	These kind of type should be forbidden angry fac My brain hurt exploding head face with tongu	1
947904739	Some PR ha to be the first one to use it beaming face with smiling ey It a bit ugly as with all FFI but it did not seem terrible	1
959781169	Hi there for some reason file a bug defect issu did not sound right while read the doc Mostli have seen usag of either report or log bug defect Ha grinning face with big ey I could be wrong too But in my opinion I felt report sound much better than file even though it is a tini change	1
122603437	yeah I was not sure if thi approach is ok and if I want to shadow as littl as possibl from the initi set happi to add some logic there	1
704844644	Thi chang does not affect anyth but make the code more clear If you look at the line about currentUrlTree is set to urlAfterRedirects	1
92501584	I also agree but let keep them for now sinc we are not done with set it up on webpack js org yet	1
94004395	I simpli took what wa abov in the same file! I do agre they do not realli make sens though	1
94504993	Yeah that make sense I have omit the output properti from the test	1
101964698	uhh good catch and ye should have further clean up	1
168005195	Then it is fine thumbs up	1
184581200	I agre we can discuss there If we need to change I will go in and remov where needed	1
206464542	Yep I wa hesitant That probabl the best move	1
225866422	No it isn t good catch	1
274094522	Yes We need to implement featur that can be use with the file url loader So I want to implement it in the next step Also I want to move all test case from these loaders	1
324006383	you are right I should have wrap the entir thing in the promise I chang it should be visibl in the latest commit	1
477496765	oh that make sense is a pretti common construct I think never mind	1
485136866	Thi look sketchy but I manual verifi that the assert should hold in all case we current have it’ just hard to encod it into the types The onli time host getCurrentDirectory is undefined are 1 The command line parser and type instal each call the modul name resolv in an ad hoc way under certain circumstances but they pass a hard cod compilerOptions that lack paths so thi code path is never taken 2 Project call getAutomaticTypeDirectives with a DirectoryStructureHost but that function never use host getCurrentDirectory Chang ModuleResolutionHost to be non opt make these call site a bit of a nuisance	1
540864006	Yeah pretti much that exactly	1
552161218	You are right becaus it would resolv complet to actual path even if equival of npm link kind of thing is use	1
567249541	I agre with the more gener point that it is rare use to look at the constraint of type when determin whether one is an instanc of the other I do think however that thi is one of the rare case where it actual is useful I complet agre with all the other point you are make slightly smiling fac I also ad your exampl to the test although I don think it will be immedi impact by the change	1
595303968	Code size performance ye I would have to agre	1
600179413	That precis what I wa describing yes	1
616117268	Seem good!	1
629735298	That look good but you could also just use a class field in the bind and updat it	1
654364216	Absolut right! Smile	1
656585390	yes thi is the way i will go about fix thi issue Pleas make sure the mechan is onli enabl dure debug mode i e wrap the logic in an assert	1
656631873	Good point In that case overflowAlign applies Thi would be a good place to mention overflowAlignment I will add it	1
657494742	Yes becaus usag indic that it is unhelpful	1
658744651	Look good! I wa unsur how to implement it cleanli in my PR so I just forc commit the changes To my PR Branch crossed fing	1
658793281	Look fine to me You could do thi with a second regex replac ! but I do not think it would make much differ to the performance and thi is pretti easi to follow	1
678725568	can we use getStart rather than pos to follow the convent in the rest of the file?	1
680251404	That is actual a good point let me think about thi more	1
687724118	right! I just push the updat commit	1
688181503	Ah ok interesting best to keep both then thumbs up	1
690000276	Yeah that is sound right I imag we probabl should not ignor casts	1
692149722	You r right What a better word for thi paragraph? How about	1
702198884	that make sense just FYI thi may lead to a bigger overal imag size although mayb with cach imag size is not an issu for our cirru builds?	1
705693089	I agree it is not bad to keep thi test even if it pass without thi chang and ha coverag in a golden file test I think it is never bad to have anoth test Smile	1
721770912	Good point and that is pretti slick but it may not help with the pretti complicated issu Factor out the resolv function make it a littl more obviou that we are just return the first MaterialStateProperti that resolv to null So That pretti close to what you had whichev way you find more readabl is OK with me	1
724610147	Aaah I see That is so true What about someth a bit more explicit like 1 Execut flutter run code below 2 ! describ step to demonstr bug 3 ! e g Tap on X see crash Thi way it also nudg folk to fill out your code templat below Smile WDYT?	1
788800390	It is the same problem duplicate ye step are differ but the problem is the same	1
874048172	yep it is bug we will fix it so we have it in experiments 1	1
880074565	Yep you are right duplicate let us close in favor thank for hing	1
881669113	Heya sorri it took me a while to respond I think I understand what you mean in your last comment about paramet normal and I agre that it is a differ issue so no need to worri about that in thi PR I think I agre with your analysi that numer paramet should not caus normal failur due to a hidden convers to strings	1
881791172	Agre if thi is need in a particular application custom structur direct are a better solution Attempt to solv thi problem gener would be a major undertaking	1
902790283	Veri good point	1
902995065	I agre that I rare need thi feature howev when I use ani of the tsconfig packages e g I often want to use both that and some base config that ha my common rule in Currently the onli way to use tsconfig packag is to maintain pariti which is to some extent just fine	1
910832606	Look good to me Pleas move forward with the PR to get your exampl implemented Thank you	1
926892894	I share your feel that duplic of token should be report as an error see grinning face with smiling eyes but strictli speak that would be a break chang and separ from thi fix	1
932418639	my approv should be enough for this	1
932482827	Good call I assum it would be an open and shut norm PR but it look like it has not been updat for a while let us hold off until is actual merged	1
938967285	Merg assistance it look like NgBot is confused the necessari approv were provided so it is safe to proceed with the merge	1
940421867	Yeah what you are say make total sense sorri I think I have just had tunnel vision on the line section as that seem the cleanest and more effici place where to put this With the regex done beforehand we will pars each file one extra time which think of that it is not even that bad as thi is just done at build time so it is not like it need to be ultra perform or anyth also regex are should be quit optim right? Anyway I would realli not mind have a crack at thi slightly smiling face but you would do a better and faster job with you mad regex skill heart eyes so I can do it or if you would enjoy thi task I am also total fine with you handl it slightly smiling face 1	1
951499389	Ahh ye ok that make sense	1
952016891	You are right it a duplicate even tho the issu is not veri well describ	1
952413616	say verbal that he is ok with it too	1
953862319	Sound good The crash is veri random but alway happen on the close of the app I will work on a minim sampl app to see if it can be reproduc easily	1
954948987	Yeah that is a good suggestion	1
956013136	Thi is the correct place to report thi issue Can you provid flutter doctor v and ani evid of plugin unabl to releas the memory	1
688053781	I actual had alreadi move thi to TextEditingActionTarget as a privat instanc method that use TextMetrics getWordPosition but I had forgotten to delet thi static method here Thank for catch this Let me know if you like it on TextEditingActionTarget or if you think it would be better on TextMetrics Regard RTL you are right I think we have a lot of miss support for this I have creat an issu and I will add TODO for it here	1
796915785	Make sense I agree we should all be pull the ecosystem toward clear standard and not a mishmash like auto mode Thanks	1
955385844	I think thi is a good change It is true that these properti can be undefin in fact they are even set to undefin explicitly So the type are not correct as they stand I agre that thi would break compil in mani projects That be said it is actual a real problem and the error will be easi to fix We could probabl write a migrat that mark these properti with ! or ? but I worri thi could then hide the problem I would like to see the result of a presubmit	1
660012447	Yes we do not current use our knowledg of what T is We could add thi featur later if we decid we realli like it dartdoc doe have enough data to figur thi out Though in thi case sinc T is defin as extend Object? it will not have an operator	1
90701231	oop grinning face with sweat I have not implement the test yet so I had not audit yet	1
94291425	wrap these line into block will make linter happi Smile	1
94530840	Yeah that look great I think that is a good approach	1
95046608	Heh did not even notic thi in the src befor that is awesome	1
150086821	If thi is just github display tab \t weirdli forget what I said then face with tongu	1
163396586	Touche Haha well we should just updat them all in one PR not thi one though face with tears of joy	1
166578897	Guy I just had not the time to final the local stuff I am work on for the postcss icss side of affairs thi stuff dependencies will be move soon from the PR Very Happy face with tongue Happi with everi postcss value parser that is capabl of pars import url for the initi CSSParser in it is default state css modules will still be an opt in either via postcss loader or someth like	1
177721513	It merged tada	1
185240719	Lmaooooo nanifest seem cooler though face with tears of joy	1
186009736	Thi is wrong for index 0	1
220100243	Is thi the correct way? I do not think so face with tongu	1
379757627	Good catch clap	1
523003305	I am not sure how to fix this nor if thi is accept in thi test case Namespac in TS are magic to me grinning face with sweat	1
523003698	Oh so you are one of those Ad a new test to cover for thi winking fac	1
571242698	Thank for the feedback Renam generateReturn to generateReturnInDocTemplate	1
571687515	Yeah that wa actual wrong not sure how it work grinning face with sweat	1
582164148	I agre that line look weird and I wa hope we could remov it too grinning squinting fac I still don’t understand that filter so I’ll have to take a closer look at what it means Thank for point out the failur in nodeServer ts That will be use to look at	1
606605808	Thanks make sens	1
614195174	Noth is do the upgrading They are just left alon grinning face with smiling ey Perhap one could say	1
638325040	After some benchmarking the simplest thing to do wa use our isWhiteSpaceLike function that we alreadi export from the scanner the simpl branch is appar faster than either the regex or a nativ Set That probabl a good thing given how much it is use insid the scanner cat fac	1
638749612	done we should start lint this! grinning face with smiling ey	1
643994320	I see good point We should be okay keep as is but should renam the function to not suggest it is similar to the async withDebugOutput helper We do not deal with ani debug output here rather it is a simpl spawnSync wrapper with our Window compat set e g shell	1
645073135	Oh goodness! My brain must have still been on vacation face savoring food Thanks!	1
655635656	Option nit It a bit tricki becaus thi assum that the properti users or teams are not defin if it would be empty Seem like thi is someth YAML does but that is not necessarili known here grinning face with smiling ey For more clariti and a more obviou check here we could alway set users and teams to an empti array if it is not defined	1
656711547	Friendli ping need some suggest hereface with tears of joy for push I see you are recent online	1
664947251	Uhh Yeah it is probabl fine there is an any due to truncat in the remov type text so all we did wa truncat more which is gener fine	1
671736550	yeah all good points I total agre with the comment regard the about the multilin thing I am not sure but yeah I think you are probabl right on those too I will need to check thank a lot!!! slightly smiling face	1
672894662	Definitely! You can alway safe mark thing as resolv when use my regex face with tongu	1
687172118	It may not be grinning face with sweat	1
695272975	Oh I see squinting face with tongu Refer thi abov for when folk are in the api doc on individu pages	1
695293645	Oh nice I did not realiz thi show up anywhere!	1
696826933	Good call I wa abl to get rid of it The previousCharact thing seem to have been use to work around these wordwrap problem mainli when getLineBoundari did not respect TextAffinity	1
702098157	TBH I do not think there is much benefit in move shell command to extern file grin speak no evil monkey smiling face with halo We do not lint test or otherwis valid them afaict and it just make it harder for author to edit them and ensur they remain relev with the surround text As much as I prefer have code snippet be deriv from docregions it might make sens to make an except for some content types such as shell commands	1
704831786	Yes aspect is so much better I have updat the code	1
711259165	Ah thanks! Yes the golden are expected I ad an imag that would otherwis be overflow onto the follow child Smile	1
714038314	You are 100 on the money with this Turn out the pars wa incorrect and so is the pars in v8 about to rais a ticket I am chang thing to the way you said and it work much better	1
719889205	I do not know where is thi sourc come from face with tears of joy	1
727413212	Yeah I just chuckl becaus when thi test wa first ad it had thi error then it got remov by anoth change then it got ad back and now it is be remov again Thi test is surprisingli good at captur how strict we are about compar infinit types even if that is not what it wa meant to test it wa meant to test a crash	1
729442182	Thi seem like an accept protocol change grinning squinting fac	1
730137163	awesom thank slightly smiling face just a coupl of question slightly smiling face do we need the group to be non capturing? thinking and I can see a small slight issu with the regex as you can see here for example we take the space after the eslint comment but is that realli correct? in thi case we will get text indent onli 5 space and not 10 do you think thi is ok? I know that in theori the eslint comment should have the same indent as the next line but who knows you can find someon els as bad as me at indent stuff laughing man shrugging	1
742384352	Thi look great!	1
783542251	Thank for point out these functions I am also 1 on use the builtin function rather than roll our own incomplet checks	1
785050492	No worri if you do not have bandwidth I can send a PR for export these types	1
796731497	I see you like the comment if you want to review that is also welcom grinning fac Thi is liter our onli blocker left	1
797460963	Also I am thing I can offici call thi issu resolv with Webpack 5 party popp party popp party popp party popp party popp party popp	1
799351710	topLevelAwait caus thi problem w had improv our code grinning face with big ey	1
875608145	Guilti as charg smiling face with halo To my defense I thought I wa do you a favor face with tongue Thx for still take a look grin	1
881638125	You guy are on top of it Cheer clinking beer mug	1

913692354	It was not when I post thi issu slightly smiling face	1
914557671	thanks for clarification I wa just a littl bit worri by thi and by the plan of use esbuild becaus esbuild does not check types But if it will be total configur it’ amazing	1
917619220	Glad you got to the bottom of thi	1
919009505	thx I switch to and everyth is work nice!	1
921236280	yeah it work perfectly!!! smile so the look ahead is ok but the look behind is not? I had not idea open mouth	1
922332071	Excel work on thi PR and mjs cj support Wes We have been discuss full ES specifi support in 42151	1
922713721	Friendli ping	1
925433950	Sorri that is what the note were meant to reflect but the convo wa happen a bit too fast I think the analog wa fine Usual the idiom it not rocket science impli thi is simple so nobodi should get overwhelm by it wherea thi is someth we don t think is simple and thu can make no guarante about whether anyon will be overwhelm by it grinning face with sweat	1
934325654	Sigh disappointed fac There use to be a time when my word wa enough face with tongu Ad a test grinning face with big ey	1
939870826	Thnx for the quick response The suggest workaround is similar to our own workaround so thnx for that! Want to share the chang in behavior winking	1
940648238	Hello! Pleas let me know which mileston will thi land to when you know Thank you grinning fac	1
942246719	with the help of I found a workaround See	1
942642232	No but I think there might be a previou issu for that too grinning squinting fac	1
948916151	Thi is great news Ad the new version to the allow list!	1
949803809	Thank for the reply Thi respons will swerv into off topic for thi thread but of cours I would be happi to submit PRs My most press issu would be Happi to discuss elsewhere	1
955085840	I think we should get opinion from peopl that do use snippets I feel total unequip to give an opinion on thi becaus I pretti much just never use snippet and I click thing heh grinning face with sweat	1
956099297	Hi thank you for file thi issue Pleas check out thi document which explain the break chang and how the flutter team handl migration	1
956562099	I am happi to see continu enthusiasm for solv thi problem Keep the upvot and especially construct suggest and PR coming! Like mani hard things eventu I am sure we will help to get a solut built for thi annoy gap in the TS develop experience As far as I can tell thi impress is not correct Almost all packag that are written in TS transpil to JS and publish to npm do not work with Go To Implementation ani more than packag origin written in JS I said almost all abov becaus there is a way to make it work use the tsconfig compil option But 1 Thi set is not enabl by default IMHO it should be enabl by default whenev sourceMap is enabled Mayb also when inlineSourceMap is enabled? 2 There is AFAICT no evangel from the TS team or anyon else! about how packag author should enabl thi set and includ declar map file when publish their packag to npm 3 There also no push to get declar map file into exist DefinitelyTyp packages Could thi be autom instead of reli on 1000 of type packag maintain to do it? Anyon who want to see thi problem get better could 1 Send a PR to tri to chang the default of declarationMap to be true if the sourceMap or inlineSourceMap option is true Thi minor chang would probabl have the biggest impact on thi problem over time 2 Send a PR to updat the TS doc to be more vehement that declarationMap should be enabl for all librari packages and explain whi becaus Go To Implementation in VS Code reli on declar map files These document chang will be crucial if 1 is not approved 3 Send a PR that add or extend the TS doc with specif guidanc for packag authors includ publish your sourcemaps and publish declar maps 4 Write a tool that will automat add declar map file to all compat DefinitelyTyp packages and convinc the DefinitelyTyp maintain to merg the output of that tool into everi compat DefinitelyTyp package Part of the work would be figur out what compatible mean and what packages declar map cannot be automated Note that abov wa pessimist that thi autom would be possible But I wonder if thing have improv sinc then to make autom possible? Or if it would be possibl for a larg subset of packages? Here what he said 5 Send a PR to chang the build action for DefinitelyTyp to warn user if they tri to add a new packag that lack a declar map Not sure if thi is someth that can be done outsid the DT maintain team depend on how the exist DT toolchain works Someon who know DT better than me could answer this The commun ha agency! If we want thing to get better ani of the item abov can make thing better There also IMHO anoth confus with Go to Definition vs Go To Type Definition are implemented My prefer would be for Go to Type Definition to navig to the type and Go to Definition to navig to the implementation Not sure thi is worth chang commun expectations though given how long the current behavior ha been in place For more details see	1
957148739	Lucki one! I guess one of the problemat packag wa updated Have a nice day! smiling face with smiling ey	1
961241626	Inde grinning face with big ey Yeah that is exactli whi thi suggest is possible But your exampl is a nest one mean that it might tri destructur undefin into a b which should be prevented	1
120718903	Yea my first attempt wa to use a set for r chunks and then convert it back at the end of the function w Array from thi wa onli margin faster than the origin code though IIRC the Array from call were take 12 seconds I can creat anoth profil show that if you want	1
262272600	Prettier chang the indent here to be sort of weird imo I am happi to chang the style of the code here that gener the System regist string open to suggestions	1
350895784	If there is a way to do that now or in the next months I am all for it thumbs up My anxieti is mostli that as you mentioned there have been similar request for a long time Plugin system are notori hard to get right and you understand want to be sure it will not bite you in the future That fine but meanwhile we are still left in a state where we have to reli on veri creativ solut a virtual filesystem! where a simpl integr would appear to work fine within the constraint of our runtime admittedly Anyway I understand what you are say and your roof your rules I will be eagerli wait for progress on 16607 then slightly smiling fac	1
367998001	I think both behavior make sens for differ use cases	1
407979876	Yes it is veri trick to detect the stop time under current solution I will take the idea mention abov and add tests smiling face with smiling ey	1
429102122	Oh yeah that sound much better than delet it I just updat my code to deprec it instead	1
465686582	Could do I consid it but thought the test that are alreadi quit loopi would get harder to follow what is go on Happi to updat if you prefer	1
497734327	After our discussion I think it is OK to leav this there are not ani equival helper already and it is use in quit a few place throughout the checker already It might be worth a cleanup pass later to holist find a replacement but that would be a lot of work	1
504865825	Inde I miss that but not sure how it did not affect the gener code In ani case fixed	1
546152955	Sound good to me Dev contain definit make thing easi onc you have VS Code and docker setup and with Codespac you can just connect and the contain will automat be setup for you	1
560580809	I look deeper into it and now should be fixed All scenario on the test are pass as expected	1
612068880	That make it easier for me cowboy hat fac	1
628253160	And inde it did fail so that is good	1
629542983	Yeah that would also work for me thumbs up	1
633892971	I agree I person do not love have it but felt it would be easier to perform the angular cli migrat to use the releas tool I suppos I should probabl just put in the effort to creat the changelog for CLI ahead of time	1
635656005	I think we can just leav it there becaus we will no longer creat new tag with the v but we can support discov the previou tag indefinitely	1
642112555	Thank you for let me know! I have fix thi now	1
646725531	Thanks I have rebas the PR and pushed look green	1
653735100	I would probabl just throw that into the string case and seed it with an empti string No need to tri to come up with a placehold that actual fit the templat grinning face with smiling ey	1
693160039	I was not sure but thi doe work Ad a test	1
694222620	Glad we are abl to remov thi now!	1
700594086	as I said I am not complet sure about it but ye it does not sound terrible and if you say it is better that way then I will just go for it then slightly smiling face 1	1
716013640	It should not matter becaus we pin to specif version via the lockfil anyway so either way is fine	1
721316882	Got it !	1
743211174	Pretti much anyth other than ToolExit will show up in crash logging You could throw a bare Exception as we do elsewher in thi file I am not picki Smile	1
824998066	star Feel free to feedback you can alway ask question here	1
870881627	I am have some success simpli appli both plugins Not sure of ani unintend side effect yet	1
893548823	Sound reasonable thanks Howev could you pleas provid the link to the issu you mentioned?	1
899511728	Basic look good sandersn Would you mind tell us how could we use baselin to test the inlay hints？It pain for now	1
903220818	sandersn Mayb I do not have too much time to investig it deeply it is ok to close the PR	1
919794646	No worries! It look great now rocket	1
923715301	The abov approv should be enough sinc thi is a lock file change	1
926852403	OK cool that‘ kind of what I meant by “squatting” on a standard lib name but refram like this perhap that’ actual an intend rather than hacki use — you’r overriding aug an exist lib so that doe fall into the 45771 use case The fact thi requir two configur point across separ file that need to be kept in sync doe still introduc more friction than I’d like and the fact that tsconfig doesn’t clearli show the actual lib in use may be a sourc of confusion but you can’t have everyth in life grinning face with big eyes Thank for take the time to consid thi anyway!	1
936532808	Thi is an inconsist in our iter checking with no contextu type the hard cod TNext default is unknown with a defective next fre contextu type the hard cod default is any instead We should mayb consid fix this but onli if it does not break anybody or if anybodi think the current state is bad enough In ani case I think thi chang is fine to ship as is	1
944920839	Thi work for me as a temporari solut of cours	1
946413492	Base on thi comment I feel it is safe to close thi issu as fixed As such I will be close it If you still experi thi issue kindli leav a comment and I will reopen Thank you	1
947807081	That a tough one to get behind But if that is where we draw the line I can respect that	1
949056793	Done for now Gener seem pretti solid Nice work	1
949082529	Yeah if the real world code is fast then I’m happy Just want to make sure it wa check against the latest changes	1
949958480	From the design discuss today we think thi is a fine chang to make but will result in such a small improv that it is not worth the churn In particular it fix the precis repro from 45798 but I doubt that it fix the origin code sinc nobodi is like to write liter number in a templat liter slot	1
952616746	I would be happi to take a look at thi as well I have a sampl Angular project that I could tri to replic the issu in What type of file are you upload or doe it occur on all files?	1
954811289	The issu is fixed Look good clapping hand	1
960145697	you are too kind As I said I cannot guarante thi to be the right answer but it is what I came up by check the behaviour and the code and it doe seem to make enough sens to me I am veri happi that you have found it use slightly smiling face	1
960321886	Thi issu on angular io ha been resolved	1
912949518	I think it is definit possibl to write a migrat for these cases but I do not think it is trivial So we would need to plan the work alongsid prioritis other work	1
86189573	Arf Unsure sokra Should I make a PR to fix it?	1
183173801	I will work on it tomorrow	1
483122434	Can you put here test case? I will help	1
616418092	Hope these chang will lead to export LoaderDefint be generated But mayb there is also a bug in the type generation We did not export gener type yet	1
639680771	I made the suggest changes thanks!	1
644306715	I can think of a coupl way to fix thi Alway return all errors then have tsc have a filter when display error for JS files Thi would add error to all other API consumers though Give the languag servic a separ way to request uncheck JS errors The checker will have to store these error separ and the languag servic will have to add them late Possibly Not report these error in the error in close files list But I do not know if that would be what user of that featur expect Opinions? Ideas? I am pretti sure that thi featur is go to stick around and grow so I would like for it to be easier to use than to not use Specifically it is annoy if the futur statu quo for the languag servic is to request diagnost twice onc for uncheck JS and again for everyth else	1
654733052	Thank for addit info thumbs up Let keep it	1
666441728	I am not so certain about whi we need to remov thi code If thi is inde a bug fixes we should have a test for this	1
672677368	I agree they are not veri comprehensive They are suppos to be smoke test to make sure that we are gener at least a minimum of the output for each of the platform without the test be too fragile I ad them becaus some symbol I wa depend on have disappeared chang name in the past and becaus we did not have ani test at all for the keygen script Just have a test file make it more like that test will get written even if it were just exit 0	1
674339040	In fact I’m confid that thi comment is the reason I had it in my head that I should not check the cancel token ten of thousand of time in a row in a loop	1
676946399	Pleas have a look I hope it is fine now slightly smiling face	1
678610731	Ad a neg test case would be a good idea too i e should not produc banana in a box warn if written correctly	1
679543716	Thanks re added! One day my LSC script will support not overrid these Smile	1
686244585	Yes thank you! I just updat with all of the constant from Android together Hope more readable Smile	1
699604800	It be great to add a comment here to explain whi we strip index html We do remov the index html onc there is noth els at the end of the URL string it would be great to includ that into the doc whi we do that Also we can probabl add test for case like to verifi that we do not remov index html if it is in the GET param part of the URL	1
716553951	I think it might be worth given that thi is a public API explain what it mean to creat an NgModul without provid a parent injector AFAICT it use getNullInjector instead	1
720548093	I do not know that we ever run thi command with asserts Perhap thi should be an explicit integr test?	1

954396291	To add thi is not someth that we can easili reproduce out of 10 devic in prod onli one devic get thi issue However when I see thi crash logs the app is not kill restart like how typic app behav when crashes Ofc thi issu is solv by restart the app But the app is expect to be use for 24h Question are there ani way we can detect thi kind of issu runtime? To notifi user to restart the app manual themselves Our user most of the time not brave enough to restart the app themselv without negoti with their manag or us	1
955972112	In order to properli address thi issue we would need a complet minim reproduc code sampl without ani 3rd parti plugin and clear step to replic the issu that throw the null error along with flutter doctor v	1
958346666	Thi would be a great optim to land If we can get it rebas and updated that would be great	1
958748054	Can you upgrad to latest stabl and see if you get same behavior ? If so provid us a complet minim code sampl without use ani 3rd parti plugins	1
960501506	Hi Thank for file the issue pleas share the minim and complet reproduc code along with the step to reproduc the issue Thi will help to replic the issu and eventu find the caus of the bug Thank	1
937914188	I do understand your advic and I agre with them Howev I am not in control of thi softwar I am work on User have angular app compil and hosted Then they buy our servic and includ our script on the page as the first script We work as an apm tool Angular app and our script are complet separated and we have 0 prod dependencies Also we have our own rollout mechan and user can disabl inject of our script via UI on demand We are work in sprint and user can onli use latest version of our softwar month in the past I do get the router instanc pass in as a paramet but from a compil app which is alreadi live in the page I am abl to subscrib to the router event via router createRouterEventHandler Is there mayb someth on the compil router instanc that I could use more in thi regards? If not at least have stringifi event as a name is a second option which is better than onli one option Event type properti would be great if there would be a plan to add that to angular Would simplifi thing a lot for us	1
947059736	Let me know if I miss someth from our convers yesterday cc who are look into	1
947447978	Ok I am pretti sure that the problem is with serial and deseri the result which is done on the main thread When I chang the kotlin code to onli return the first 5 entri after fetch all of them there were no lost frames	1

602607176	thumbs up In my defense reportError was not there when I wrote thi code grinning face with sweat	1
633828940	Oh never mind these are deps not peer deps!!	1
639302215	ani reduct is good! As long as the number of call did not increas I am not too concerned It also worth noth that thi test is for View Engin languag service which is no longer the default in v12	1

725465717	wow that wa a hell of a typo fixed!	1
798606383	I am afraid it is not easi to fix even more I think it is not fixable I wa wrong not hard to fix	1
799352104	Yep it is just workaround	1
843115609	Thank for your response I realis that there wa someth more to that problem that I did not understand The incorrect map that I wa see happen when I wa explor a fail React client sid rehydr by follow the stack trace in the console When I tri to reproduc it in a simpler scenario the dev tool redirect me to the correct sourc file So I delet my comment but not fast enough for nobodi to notic grinning face with smiling ey Sorri for that The delet comment read as follows	1
873370671	I tri to revert webpack version to 5 41 1 project work fine!	1
877811803	Sorri for the delay respons on this I think you are right it seem like it wa swallow the error instead of show it I have adjust my code and everyth work as intended I believ thi issu can be closed!	1
891882719	resolv I dont know but it is work fine today on that same branch	1
896368442	I have to say I am also dishearten by this A team could spend a long time build a librari and assum that if it compiles it will work! onli to find out after turn declarations on that they have a ton of veri difficult to solv errors It not intuit and not veri much document that there are such limitations I am happi I am find thi out now by chance	1
904153362	I just fix an annoy bug that would have been caught by this I wa do string interpol to construct an URL in CSS I cannot imagin anyon ever intend to load url undefined Thank for the eslint rule links	1
906573092	ah thank you! I bet that’ what is talk about The exampl I test all had initializers It’ a littl hard to repro someth without a code snippet grinning face with sweat	1
916909700	Just to flag i had thi same error on version 4 4 2 on Mac OS 11 5 2 Downgrad to 4 3 5 and error not present	1
917040100	Yes that is right! I have to admit I did not even search I alway assum we are the onli odd peopl who care about the comment emit that much	1
917608676	thi work around works! Final found it after wast hour search for the solution Thi is especi annoy when tri to wrap a type as a promise sinc that also does not work correctli with specifi a separ promise wrap type Ani new on if thi is go to be fixed?	1
947630112	Actual it turn out that behavior doe not reproduc in master my bad So it wa fixed thank for the support!	1
948203695	I switch the Flutter version to master and it succeed Thank you!	1
948322120	Then I feel it is safe to close thi issue Close as solved	1
948562007	Hi sorri not to respond so far on thi issue It is a bit tricki to implement on our side I need to talk with about how thi could work I am not sure if it is someth we would do I am glad that for the time be you appear to have a workaround	1
950707181	Alright I thought it an error Smile	1
953595449	I stand corrected thank you Although it is quit difficult to figur out what featur came out with what version The document you link with verified onli mention an expected year	1
955683969	God onli thi work for me Thank	1
958923728	I found a way to resolv thi issu not quit effici but it is work fine! use bloc and creat just one CameraControl and also make the bloc act like a synchron block and not initi the camera if there is an activ event on it is solv the problem but I guess I can found a better navig system to not creat and listen to the life cycl chang in app mani times Thank for your advices	1
703366846	Great ideas implement thumbs up light skin ton and push	1
716035218	Might have found a solut here slightly smiling face	1
718870954	ah nice! Wa abl to cleanup all the test with thi change	1
926829428	Thi got OK d at a design meet thumbs up light skin ton	1
94140211	Ah nice idea that may be the cleanest solution	1
94406257	Interest workaround grinning face with smiling ey	1
155162450	On it! grinning face with sweat	1
247250572	Everi time you comment I realiz someth new about JS or TS Thi is veri exciting smiling face with smiling ey	1
571246442	Nonetheless I rework to make it start at the nearest possibl ancestor instead of the sourc file and skip it altogeth in case where neither list element went through a transform which is the onli way they could be reorder or reparented I think	1
624072499	I like your suggest wording Let go with that!	1
640820626	Ah cool I did not know that!	1
641000887	I’m open to suggest for a better name or for do thi differently and there’ no reason right now that it need to be a function instead of a readonli value The deal is that the emit host must get a non empti answer when it ask for a modul specifi between two files wherea the languag servic host can get an empti answer sinc it onli use modul specifi resolut for auto import rel things Thi allow the two host to distinguish those requirements The name would be much easier to understand if it were inverted like requireResolutionResults or someth still not great but that would mean it either need to default to true or be a break API chang for ModuleSpecifierResolutionHost implement which is internal so mayb not so bad I initi plan to add thi valu as a paramet to getModuleSpecifiers et al but that ha weird implic for cach technic it should be part of the cach key but in practice each host should alway pass the same value	1
666619504	the more document the better!	1
685488755	Ooo thi is a veri excit change There are so mani work around for thi that we could clean up Smile	1
694491680	Also worth mention how thi interact with text composition	1
699357686	I think these comment are great!	1
706468634	Fair I will fix this Previous we could not use that becaus 255 wa also special case Smile	1
707986098	May want to also mention that use thi result in more granular explicit set of chang rather than batch togeth gener updat to the edit value We want to help develop find decid if thi featur is right for them	1
715807530	I will tri to find a workaround to remov these 2 imports	1
816711243	wow that sound amazing I will take a look asap thumbs up will the result be cached?	1
873607864	Can I tri to fix thi problem？	1
889890044	Hi thi is a great thread read! I have a token in the deploy stage of my pipelin that replac and env variable It seem that thi should caus an issu for the SW Is that correct? Is there a workaround? the project is alreadi built at thi point	1
908748646	Give thi a bump becaus I think it is still an import issu to fix	1
910456535	Feel like a best effort is like better than noth here Though I would lean toward show noth if there’ an ambigu as in example	1
916232072	Thi is a fantast featur but what about take it a step farther and requir use of the virtual keyword on the base class so you can actual control when you want to allow sub class to overrid or not? That could also be an opt in switch noImplicitVirtual There are often situat where overrid a function without call super could break the application	1
918421589	I do not think I follow 33200 is about Object values of enums but thi PR chang Array includes The problem in 33200 also seem to be about string liter not be assign to string enum member with the same value But your object sound more general Is it? Discuss that and propos a solut would be good to do in a separ issu from 33200 especi sinc that one alreadi closed	1
925049118	Hi great progress here How is it go with merge? I want to encourag you to finish it It would be unfortun to stop here A lot of dev have problem with this Thanks	1
927860156	I can help in this can you assign it to me	1
934576358	Hello ! Pleas let me know if you are not work on thi anymor so that I can take thi forward smiling face with smiling ey	1
940400304	Okay fair comment that make sense I will do my best to get one up and run thanks! Will tri and get it done thi week Inidentally tri to figur thi out myself I came across extendedDiagnostics and thi show that all the node modules are be type chcked wonder if thi might be why? Or if there is ani use output avali from thi aid where to look?	1
946966708	Assign myself while I investig this Related Mayb related	1
947350117	You can use workaround mention in same issu to get it working Or also tri to switch to latest master and run again to see if it still persist or not	1
948236795	Okay I will do it	1
949076777	I will reiter that I am with ignor my repro sinc I probabl made nonsens out of the logic while tinker with it Obviously never be slow is the ideal but it is more import to focu on code peopl might actual write Alternatively we could call thi good and file a separ bug to go investig that repro	1
949356494	I can help on this you can assign it to me	1
949692147	Thank you for replay I have done a rudimentari implement with a SliverToBoxAdapt and a Stack it is not ok I will tri some other way to fix it and let you know if ha result	1
949781457	I would be veri happi to review and help merg updat to the doc that highlight these known issues if you would like to send in some PRs	1
949956387	Would like to work on this How do I get started?	1
950196065	Clarif on abov comment I wa respond to someon who mistakenli thought code and code2 in the repro code were the same variable That comment ha sinc been deleted but I left my respons in case someon els make the same mistake	1
952939031	Feel free to give it a go rocket It is still on my TODO list but I will not get to it for anoth week or so I would be happi for someon to beat me to it grin	1
954592493	I think it would be better to document a featur after it been released slightly smiling fac And by the way I am realli excit about thi feature red heart	1
955208564	we decid to fix forward so thi PR is not needed closing	1
956023992	Thank you for the screenshot I will be label it for further investig as I cannot reproduc on my end	1
956472417	I am not sure I understand your question so I will just answer broadly Basically there is an includ mechan for these GDPR comments but you cannot includ someth from anoth repo Sinc both repo refer to the same fragment both repo have to declar it Whi have a reusabl fragment for a singl property? I am pretti sure there use to be multipl and I assume there might be multipl in the future	1
957549827	Thi doe not necessarili mean that the bug doe not exist Feel free to write back if you encount the issu again with some more detail and reproduc step I would be happi to take a look Thank	1
957564557	Thank you for your reply I will prepar a new project and I will tri to make it have the same issu and provid it for the investigation	1

921046688	We’r now track thi at 44953—a full repro would still be help folded hand	1
666530178	It alway good to explicitli type array like this Also thi can be const sinc we do not need to chang it value	1
736898221	ahhhh yeah thinking slightly smiling face 1	1
619287712	That how format it Smile	1
952388360	Is there an easi way to pass time as a uniform from flutter? I see that I can pass in some uniform to the fragmentshad constructor what is the glsl layout syntax for access them? Do I need to pass by refer or pointer somehow so they get updat each frame? Sorri if I am not make sense Thi is a littl outsid my comfort zone but fragment shader is a featur I am realli excit about!	1
622382190	Ummm me too Neither one of these function are specif to jsdoc so jsdoc specif code is surpris in both Probabl mean that thi is good enough	1
928896400	Oops sorry my bad! However I have overwork for sever weeks includ weekends and have almost no time left for thi PR Sad But good new is that a 7 day holiday is coming start at 10 1 hope I could finish the ream work dure these days!	1

623086599	As the chang current stand I am not a huge fan of extract thi function It make the diff pretti hard to read On the other hand if ad set test show that the code need to be more complex it might tip the balanc more strongli toward have a separ function	0

950728707	I have the exact same issue For me it happen for all kind of widget tests not just for text input I am also on MacO and can confirm that run flutter clean then run the test again would solv the issue Anoth thing to note is that I am pretti sure I did not have thi issu befor Flutter 2 5 Mayb someth introduc in 2 5 caus thi issue	0
955954934	and other thi ha been fix in latest webpack for almost a week now pleas check the last comment and do not copi the first workaround you find it is both unnecessari and might break other Node tools	0
957125817	Yeah exactli the same issue Thank for the link But i need to recod to accomod the updat pluging I know i am ask for too much but i just hope pluge develop do not just remov the featur just like that	0
740060843	I am not convinc that multiformat run of ngcc are more typic even on the command line Obvious the CLI will target onli one properti per entry point But command line user who are not do someth similar bi provid a list of accept properti and ask to onli build the first one are probabl wast a lot of time process format that are not used But I think it is reason to keep one of the two properti or format in the info message But I found that keep both just ad a lot of nois to the message make it less helpful	0
101927254	That not the same as before Would be a break chang if you chang this	0
139083319	I guess thi could be more effici processed but I guess it would break the code gener becaus of the assumpt that the prefix can be replac with a string literal But as nobodi write such code by hand and babel will not gener thi code first argument to concat is alway an expression we can keep it simple	0

282613868	My primari concern is performance I would rather avoid lookup against the resolver for everi gener identifier if possible The onli case where thi check seem like it is need is so incur the cost of the lookup for every hoist variabl is unnecessari overhead I would still recommend that we add addBlockVariableDeclaration for thi case but we can mark it as for now and revisit the API for custom transform consumpt later	0

949907634	angular packag seem to be veri tightli control by Google Whi not commun that angular animations is and we can quibbl about word here unmaintained I would wager that those who reli on it would like to know that it ha been significantli de prioritized quietly Whi not loudli request commun or corpor support? We know where the bugs flaws and deficit are Not sound the alarm about them outsid of issu tracker and use an ALL ENGIN GO! tone in the documentation commun is unhelp and infuri for the peopl who have to dig around in the code to see what is realli go on I love Angular However the commun issu policies? combin with actual bug make me understand whi there is no amount of money most JS React and Vue develop can be paid to learn Angular It a shame! Angular NgRx are the best way to structur code for the web I have describ use Angular as run with rock in my shoes Veri nice shoe that help you run veri fast to be sure but the rock eventu leav your toe bloody Angular ha a lot of issues More than most open sourc projects While featur like option modul have been get a lot of attention modul are not one of the issu keep develop from adopt or learn Angular Poor communication bugs and move slowli on common functionality featur larg and small Zone js async await no passiv HostListen w\o hacks etc are keep develop out It also hard to get a deep insight into what is actual go on with Angular development That inform is scatter across GitHub Twitter Medium a smatter of newsletters courses and videos or is intern to Googl and not commun to extern develop at all The Angular blog has not been updat sinc earli June and the Twitter account is often surfac level DR PR Read the Twitter account the most robust Angular news aggregator you would have no idea that a major Angular packag like anim is unmaintained How do you stay truli informed? From the outsid it seem like the day to day problems bug are here to stay I have never seen a larg open sourc project run like Angular It not working Here a posit example Thi is how I keep up to date with Django development Typic there are a few post similar to this on the https www djangoproject com that contain a link to extensive develop friendly releas notes for each release To compare Angular homepag doe not featur the latest releas LTR latest or dev next and Angular are less useful New featur link to sometimes sever GitHub issu and releas note are not link anywher on the Angular homepage I think thi is by design? Hide the version number to keep from scare off new developers? I think it is time for an Angular Foundat similar in structur to Django Python or GNOME s Thoughts?	0

897390797	Yes you are right thank you!	0
897934488	I love this it is basic what I alway hope Ivi would enable However I am confus about how updat will work I realiz the syntax is nowher close to final but I will use it as a refer for discussion In the example if you use plain JavaScript express if switch for etc in your createView call instead of NgIf NgSwitch NgFor etc would not you have to destroy and recreat your view each time your context chang expensive ? If you limit yourself to use the built in structur direct instead then you could simpli pass a new context to your embed view but I can imagin that dev familiar with React might assum that plain express would just work as they do in React which might be a pain point If we do need to limit ourselv to use structur direct over plain express then it may be appropri to provid some helper function for the built in stuff so mayb instead of this You could do Of course the commun could build helper function like that themselves My main concern is that the way express restrict the abil to updat a view may trip peopl up Thank for share thi openly! I am excit for all the thing a more dynam Angular could bring	0
900573730	That done now Thank for your help	0
902251602	I like the proposal though it seem the usag will not be easi then again such code should be quit local to special dynam components not spread around the whole application so it should be manag and I would echo the call for helper offline compil that can convert string templat into sampl code in a vagu analog situation write C express trees be abl to inspect regular compil output save me mani hours You are ask about the need to support dynam TemplateRef gener it is probabl not absolut essential but I would realli like it In most use case I have in mind we would want to drive our UI with data tabl definitions charts tooltip etc Be abl to gener a templat and integr it with the exist code would be excellent	0

914581132	Love the effort the Angular team is put into these RFCs I have been veri impress as of late! not that I was not impress befor that is! I agre that the latenc realli stymi the effect and creativ of developers especi when make small chang thi is a rel term base on your specif scenario obviously HMR can be a way around thi but I have yet to see an implement that work realli well I have alway want Angular to embrac a more paralleliz compil although the compil up till now ha been fantastic as larg app start to get a littl iffi other solut to thi obviously such as increment compil from Nx micro frontend use modul feder etc but these are all more involv than optim the compiler for the dev obviously not for the angular term persay I actual wrote a blog post on the bundl size spe for our compani code base as I have been interest in thi for a while I like the idea of be abl to allow for type check to be more of a lint check but would either need to be well thought out sinc as mention type check get more import the larger the codebas or it would need to be opt in We use Nest and Nx at Trelli and the way nx serv nest app work is it will actual restart the server even if there are type error and not hold up the refresh cycle Thi can be handy except when it is not ie you did not notic you forgot to pass in a new function paramet and that whi your endpoint does not work for example In my opinion extreme is the long term solut here other tool are start to integr and support non TS base tool like esbuild and swc as they are written in Rust or other more perform languages I love Angular and do not want it to fall behind in term of compil perform or DX becaus it is not embrac new tools Of cours I realiz thi is a major lift and will take a lot of time and effort so I do not expect the Angular team to just go and implement it overnight but do strongli believ we need to keep up to date with tooling The Angular CLI ha alway been one of the best sell point of Angular and one of the best built in CLI tool out there let us not let it fall behind All in all I love thi RFC and support optim the pipelin wholeheartedly the better we make it for the develop use it the more peopl will use it and love it	0

924140805	Just comment on the close bug We don’t unsubscrib from close issues and if there is a reason to reopen them or reengag with them we do—a is happen here I think you’r forget that you have way of make plausibl correct subtyp of object in JavaScript It’ true that if you wind up with primit you’r kind of stuck You can also do some arguabl correct thing with user defin type guards which are not check for accuracy but are not wrong and are less suspici than cast to any If you have some pattern of runtim reflect that TypeScript can’t analyze but you’v convinc yourself of it safeti and it utility I don’t think I’d call that “shenanigans” anyway I’d call it a limit of our compiler I guess we’ll have to agre to disagre about what type paramet are for I won’t be monitor thi thread anymor as the discuss ha been exhaust of anyth use to resolv the origin issue	0

That sound like veri strang UX that we would not want to expose Or the sheet could alway snap to the avail snap point so you could drag to the max size but if max size is not a snap size you would snap back down to the nearest snap size That sound more sane but still weird UX And thi construct still does not ensur that user do not attempt to specifi snap point that are outsid of min and max we l still need an assert at least for that case What do you think about stay with just a plain old list and a bool or just a plain list and no bool with the ad caveat that thi mean an empti list will enabl snap which is awkward ? Thi keep us in line with the one compar exampl I know of LinearGradient stops and it feel like we are ad a lot of complex to avoid reli on assert errors I am not sure I see the tradeoff be worth it I could move the assert error into the sheet constructor so it is easier for dev to interpret the stacktrace would that help? and or we could return an order list instead of throw if an unord list is provided but I think it is better to loudli fail than silent do someth weird I cannot imagin a develop intent suppli an undord list it l make their code way less readable If the list is unordered it is probabl the result of a bug and it is better to fail so the develop can root caus the issu than to continu with potenti unintend snapSizes	0

877601081	I feel that thi decis is wrong in mani ways Angular and RxJ go hand in hand from the beginning In fact I came to know RxJ thank to Angular I do not think thi wa a bad decision It wa a nice standard way for Angular to be reactive For me the place where it wa not used like Input or lifecycl hooks feel out of tone from the rest of Angular How do you plan to remov or replac Angular depend on RxJ without introduc a massiv backward incompat breakup like in the AngularJ Angular 2 era? Don t repeat histori but learn from it! If you manag to not creat backward incompat issues then whi do you think that introduc input as observ will? It already is possibl to mere see the usag of observable observ as a Subscrib pattern RxJ wa meant to be function around thi pattern But becaus Observ wa not an ECMA standard like Promise Observ wa includ in RxJS If I rememb correctly Ben Lesh regret hi decis not to make Observ a separ lib apart from RxJS becaus now the two are seen as one while in fact they are not I hope thi decis is revert soon and Angular will return to it is declar reactiv path instead of hold on to partli forc user to use error prone imper reactiveness	0

941234580	I think you’r right that thi would be fairli easi from an implement standpoint but there are two main reason whi we don’t want to move forward without care consider of the full problem space 1 If we simply add a flag that allow modul resolut to work with ts files it will 100 contribut to the misconcept that TypeScript does can or should emit JS file with the transform import foo ts → import foo js We alreadi have angri mob demand that thi happen for import foo → import foo js so if we allow ts extens on there without it be veri clear what use case it is intend to serve it would just pour fuel on that fire 2 Such a flag would look like a gift to Deno users but it would actual be woefulli incomplet for them There are obvious a lot of other part of modul resolut that are either specif to Deno or share between Deno and the browser that we don’t current support and I think those user would be confus and disappoint that we stop so far short of proper support for these things Don’t get me wrong I want us to solv all of these problems but we’r still in the phase where we’r tri to develop a thorough understand of all the differ reason peopl want thi and what the exist solut are	0
944216399	While I do agre with my argument whi thi should not realli be consid a bug would be on a much more fundament level There is not much typescript can do about thi without break it is The onli altern would be treat properti that are known to be getter the same as function calls which is not what you want in most cases they are almost alway suppos to be treat like regular properties Thi kind of check is quit common check to prevent check if a valu is not null so flag it base on the signatur alon would be annoy to most peopl that dont have such edg case use as they would have to do the non nul assert even if it is not realli needed So ye the onli way you could detect it without troubl peopl when it mostli is not necessari is by analyz the flow in depth which is not worth it for such an edg case in my opinion but the issu abov ha more discuss on that On top of that a simpl way to avoid thi use modern ECMAScript featur is a member? do	0

920222212	Whi did you close thi issue? Your answer is anoth prove that the TypeScript crew should do something with thi request The plugin you send is not compat with the nativ typescript library It for ttypescript which is fork by a random guy probabl becaus you did not want to implement some functionalities Creat custom transform could be a solution but it should be support by a nativ typescript librari with offici support I guess that develop would be satisfi with such a solution especi that it offer much more Could you share info if TypeScript support such plugins? Still I do not know whi did you close thi issu if you did not provid a solut on how to resolv path use nativ typescript library which thi request refer to If you want to say do not use typescript – use everyth else just say it directly but it is not a definit of contribut to thi library nor solv thi issue	0

934533771	Honestly thi is get ridiculous It clear that you do not know what the heck you are talk about In the brief exampl you cannot call meth becaus TypeScript correctli narrow it to never Thi is due to the behaviour of assign narrow the type of variables TypeScript see that a Foo is assigned but no Foo So tri to narrow it to Foo use bar in ff result in never becaus it cannot be a Foo If you take thi behaviour out of the equat e g by return the valu from a function you will get the issu mentioned	0
934976734	I am not say that a type cannot have addit properti I said the exact opposit myself I am say the compil is correct when handl f as Foo due to Foo not have bar becaus it alreadi is the expect behaviour The compil is optimist and handl as exact types with respect to the in operator Thi is enough for the vast major of case if you use good program practices I never had ani problem use in to determin the type neither in my person project nor in my work Thi wa explain here Yes it is a duplic and even if it wasn t the issu is incoher and must be close	0

859539722	Your suggest doe not work and no asset file is be emit by the generator See my demo chang and the build log My intent of thi issu thread is not seek for help or ask a question but report a bug regress in Webpack 5 as it ha deprec the file raw url loader in favor of nativ asset modul and current it is not possibl to load asset from within a loader while load them from regular import work of course Also special syntax should not be need for this becaus otherwis it is a break change and thi is not documented And if thi is inde needed then how is a loader suppos to know when a certain request is an asset and when not? Thi is not the job of the loader but the modul rule configur and webpack resolv it correctly I have not found ani document in regard to thi request syntax and thu took a look at the code and found the respons part in the resolve hook of the NormalModuleFactory https github com webpack webpack blob 6a4cb8e39d717ef3d710eaebd3db31accf229dec lib NormalModuleFactory js L353 L374 While set breakpoint and debug through thi code it look like a simpl type override but unfortun it does not do anyth in thi case The this ruleSet exec call from abov which is suppos to find the rule where the asset type is defin I think does not return anyth either	0
