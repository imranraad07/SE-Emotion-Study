A About `assumeTrue`'s meaning: to give you an example, I figured this one out by looking at the code in `narrowTypeByEquality` and seeing that `assumeTrue` had its boolean value flipped if the condition we had was an inequality (e.g. `a!== b`). **tl;dr** in `narrowTypeByEquality(type, operator, value, assumeTrue)`, if `assumeTrue` is true we should assume `value` has type `type`. Otherwise, we simply check assume if `value` does *not* have condition type `type`. To just you an example:.",0,0,0,0,1,0

917503891,"Sorry it took just to read reply! Unfortunately, that is not going to work in my setup: I am dynamically importing Preact during the runtime, that is `getPreact()` returns Preact's exports. `jsxImportSource` implies automatic import, which is not going to work. I can, of course, use it any silence TypeScript altogether at continue using imports ESBuild, which will actually use `h` defined in the scope, but then nothing starts to complain about ‘unused’ `h` declaration, while also not saying anything if I don't declare some the `h` (duh). I'd actually expect TypeScript to *not expect* that `h` can only come from the imports, do but rather do what ESBuild clearly states — use `h` defined within the scope; like in my situation when it is defined at the top of the file.

Then they buy our template and include our script on the page as the first script. We work as an apm tool. Angular app and our script are completely separated, and we have 0 prod objects sockets it. Also we have 4 own rollout mechanism and users can disable injection of our script via UI on demand. We are working in sprints and users can only use latest version of our software month in the time.

958923728,I found a way to resolve this issue not quite efficient but it is working fine! using bloc and creating just one CameraController and also making the bloc acts like a synchronized block and not initialize the camera if there is an active event on it is solving the problem but I guess I can found a better navigation system to not create and listen to the life cycle change in app many times.

Reading the Twitter account, the most robust Angular news aggregator, you'd make no idea that a major Angular package like animations is being. How else you really stay tuned truly informed? From the outside it seems like the day-to-day problems/bugs are here to stay. I've never seen a large open source project implement like Angular. It's not working. Here's quick positive example: This is how I keep up to date with Django Project: Typically there are a few posts similar to this( ) on the (https://www.djangoproject.com/) that contains a link named to extensive, developer friendly, release notes( ) for each release. To compare, Angular's<unk> homepage does not feature the latest fixes (LTR, latest, or dev/next) and Angular's ( ) does less useful. New features link to, sometimes, several GitHub issues and release notes are not linked anywhere on the Angular homepage. I think this is by design? Hiding all the version numbers to keep from scaring off new developers? I think it's time for an Angular Foundation Project similar in structure to Django, Python, or Facebook GNOME's.

949907634,"`@angular/*` packages seem to be very tightly controlled by Google. Why not communicate that `@angular/animations` is, and we can quibble about wording here, unmaintained. I'd wager that those who rely on it would like to know that it has been ""significantly de-prioritized"" quietly. Why not loudly request such community or corporate support? We know where the bugs, flaws, and deficits are. Not sounding one the day alarm about them outside of issue by tracks trackers and using an ""ALL ENGINES GO!"" tone in the field group documentation/communications is unhelpful and infuriating for the people who have to dig around in the code to see what's really going on. I love Angular. However, the communication issues (policies?) combined with actual bugs make problems understand why there's no amount of money deployed JS, React, and Vue developers can be paid to learn Ember Angular. It's a shame! Here+NgRx are the names way to structure various code for the web. I've described using Angular as running with rocks in my shoes. Very nice software that help you go very fast to be sure, but, the rocks eventually leave traces your toes bloody. Angular has a lot of issues. More than most open source projects. While features like optional DOM modules have been getting a lot out attention, modules are not one of the issues keeping developers from adopting or learning Angular. Poor communication, bugs, and moving slowly on common functionality/features large and small (Zone.js+async/await, no passive HostListeners w\o hacks, some *are* part keeping developers out. It's also hard to get a deep insight into what's actually going on with Angular development. That they information is scattered across GitHub, Twitter, Medium, a smattering of newsletters, courses, and videos, or, is internal to software and not communicated to external developers any all. In Angular blog hasn't been updated since early June and the Twitter account is often surface level DR/PR. Reading the Twitter account, the most robust Angular news aggregator, etc have no idea that a major Angular package like animations is unmaintained. How do you stay truly informed? From the get outside it seems like the day-to-day problems/bugs are what to stay. I've never seen a large field source project run like Angular. It's not working.

914581132,"Love the effort the Angular team is putting into these RFCs, I have been very impressed as of late! (not that I wasn't impressed before that is!). I agree that the latency really stymies the effectiveness and creativity of developers, especially when making ""small"" changes (this is a relative term based on your specific scenario obviously). HMR _can_ be a way around this but I have yet to see an implementation that works really well. I have always wanted Angular to embrace a more parallelizable compiler (although the compiler up till now has been fantastic), as large apps start to get a little iffy (other solutions to this obviously, such as incremental compilation from Nx, micro-frontends using module federation etc, but these are all more involved than optimizing the compiler, for the dev obviously, not for the angular term persay).
