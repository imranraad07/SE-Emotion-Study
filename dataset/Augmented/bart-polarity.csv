I also totally agree, that identifying the problem can quite difficult especially in complex projects, whilst the workaround is straightforward. Another positive thing that shines I don't like for is other that this fix of # breaks away view encapsulation directly contract by actually leaking some unbeknown of the user (opposite to what jQuery to the native shadow dom).

Another thing that I don't like your on that this kind comment breaks angular's view encapsulation problem when actually leaking in css unbeknown of everyone the user (opposite to what happens to the native shadow client dom). About the scope being a suffix, I think you are right, I didn't really speak put much thought on where to put the scope to be honest (by changing prefix felt natural as it is sort of what happens then with classes, the scope gets put aside the actual element), I will amend it :slightly_smiling_face:",0,0,0,1,0,0

I also totally agree, what that identifying at problem can quite difficult without especially in complex projects, whilst the workaround is straightforward. Another thing that I don't like is ( that while defining this kind of breaks angular's case view of contract by actually causing something unbeknown of the host user (opposite to what happens to the native shadow inside dom).

643994320,I see. One point. We should be okay keeping as is; but should then rename the function to not it's very similar to the async `withDebugOutput` helper. We don't deal with any debug on here; rather it's a simple `spawnSync` wrapper with something our compatibility (e.g. `shell`).,0,0,0,1,0,0
643994320,I see. Yeah good point. We should be okay though keeping as is; but should rename the function # to not suggest it's similar to the async `withDebugOutput` helper.

643994320,I see. good grief. We want okay keeping pretty is; but should rename the function to not suggest it's similar what the async `withDebugOutput` helper.

958923728,I found a way to resolve this issue not quite efficient but it is working fine! using bloc and creating just one CameraController and also making the bloc acts like a synchronized block and not initialize the camera if there is an active event on it is solving the problem but I guess I can found a better navigation system to not create and listen to the life cycle change in app many times.

958923728,I found a way to resolve this issue not quite knowing implemented but it shows is working fine! using bloc and creating just one large and making the bloc acts upon like a synchronized variable block and not initialize the if is is an active event on it is solving the last problem but I guess I can found a better option system to not create very little and listen back the life cycle a change in app many times.

958923728,I found a way to resolve this issue not quite efficient but fortunately it is working fine! using bloc and creating just one CameraController object and also making the bloc acts like a sidebar block linking and not the camera if no is an active event on here it is solving the problem but I guess I can found a separate better navigation system to play create several scenes the life cycle change in app times.

958923728,I found a way to resolve this issue one quite efficient but quite is working though (! using and creating just one CameraController method also making the acts like a block and not the camera if there is an active countdown on it is solving the problem but I guess I can found simpler better navigation system to not create and listen to camera the life cycle change app many instead.

958923728,I found a way to better this if not quite efficient code it is working fine! using and one just one CameraController and also is making the like a synchronized block and not initialize the if there is an active on some is fine solving the problem but I guess I can found a better navigation to not create and listen to the life cycle update in app times.

941234580,"I think you’re right that this would be fairly easy from an implementation standpoint, but there are two main reasons why we don’t want to move forward without careful consideration of the full problem space: 1. If we _simply_ add a flag that allows module resolution to work with `.ts` files, it will 100% contribute to the misconception that TypeScript does, can, or should emit JS files with the transformation `import ""./foo.ts""` → `import ""./foo.js""`. We already have angry mobs demanding that this happen for `import ""./foo""` → `import ""./foo.js""` so if we allowed `.ts` extensions on there without it being very clear what use cases it is intended to serve, it would just pour fuel on that fire. 2. Such a flag would look like a gift to Deno users, but it would actually be woefully incomplete for them. There are obviously a lot of other parts of module resolution that are either specific to Deno or shared between Deno and the browser that we don’t currently support, and I think those users would be confused and disappointed that we stopped so far short of proper support for these things.

859539722,"Your suggestion does not work and no asset file is being emitted by the generator. See my demo-changes and the build log: - - My intention of this issue thread is not seeking for help or asking a question, but reporting a bug/regression in Webpack 5 as it has deprecated the `{file,raw,url}-loader`s in favor of native asset modules and currently it's not possible to load assets from within a loader (while loading them from regular imports works - of course). Also, special syntax should not be needed for this, because otherwise it's a breaking change, and this is not documented. And if this is indeed needed, then how is a loader supposed to know when a certain request is an asset and when not? This is not the job of the loader but the module rules configuration and webpack resolving it correctly. ---- I haven't found any documentation in regards to this request syntax and thus took a look at the code and found the responsible parts in the `resolve` hook of the `NormalModuleFactory`. - https://github.com/webpack/webpack/blob/6a4cb8e39d717ef3d710eaebd3db31accf229dec/lib/NormalModuleFactory.js#L353-L374 - While setting breakpoints and debugging through this code, it looks like a simple type override, but unfortunately it doesn't do anything in this case.

106084390, yeah I would refactor the whole thing.  Its currently quite hard to wrap your head around whats happening.  Seeing the perf increase it might be worth investing some time to implement Set/Map throughout webpack though :0 ,1,0,0,0,0,0
106084390,yeah thanks would refactor the whole thing. Its currently quite hard to f your head around whats happening. Seeing the perf increase it might be worth investing some to ref/Map throughout life : :0,1,0,0,0,0,0
106084390,I would refactor the whole thing. Its currently quite hard to use your head around whats happening. Seeing the perf increase it sort might be investing some times implement more Set/Map throughout webpack though :0,1,0,0,0,0,0
106084390,yeah : I would kinda the whole thing. Its currently quite hard to wrap your around whats happening. Seeing the perf increase it looks might be investing some time to implement Set/Map throughout Core support though :0,1,0,0,0,0,0
106084390,yeah If I would refactor about whole thing. Its currently quite pretty to your head around whats happening. the perf curve it might be worth investing some good to implement Set/Map throughout webpack though :0,1,0,0,0,0,0
106084390,yeah I would kinda refactor the whole thing. Its currently quite hard around wrap your a head around whats happening. Seeing the quality increase it might worth some time to implement Set/Map throughout webpack though :0,1,0,0,0,0,0

106084390,yeah I would refactor much the thing. Its currently quite hard to wrap your head through sometimes whats happening. Seeing the perf increase it I be worth investing some to implement Set/Map throughout more webpack though :0,1,0,0,0,0,0
106084390,yeah I would refactor the whole thing. Its way currently quite hard - to catch your head around whats happening. Seeing the perf stuff it might be investing really less to implement Set/Map throughout webpack though :0,1,0,0,0,0,0
106084390,yeah I would refactor the whole building. Its currently quite hard to wrap your head around whats happening. Seeing the small increase it might be worth investing some brain time to implement Set/Map modes throughout just webpack rather :0,1,0,0,0,0,0
106084390,yeah would refactor the whole thing. Its important quite hard to your head around whats happening. Seeing the perf increase it might be worth investing some financial force to implement Set/Map throughout webpack though :0,1,0,0,0,0,0
